        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Lasagna is a <strong>traditional Italian dish</strong> known for its rich layers of flavors and textures. 
                It consists of wide, flat pasta sheets stacked with alternating layers of a savory filling, 
                which typically includes a hearty meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese,
                and generous amounts of melted cheese, such as mozzarella and Parmesan. The sauce is often
                made with a slow-cooked blend of tomatoes, garlic, onions, and ground meat, such as beef
                or pork, seasoned with herbs like oregano and basil. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked
                until the top is golden brown and bubbling, creating a deliciously crispy crust while
                keeping the layers underneath tender and flavorful. This comforting and satisfying 
                dish is a favorite in Italian cuisine and is enjoyed worldwide, often served as a
                main course for family gatherings and special occasions.

                        To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce,
                        overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat
                        sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
