        <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
            <p>
                Deep-fried turkey is a flavorful and crispy alternative to traditional roasted turkey.
                The whole bird is seasoned, often with a dry rub or marinade, then submerged in hot oil
                and fried until golden brown. This cooking method locks in juices, resulting in tender,
                moist meat with a crispy, flavorful skin. It’s a popular choice for holiday meals, especially
                in Southern U.S. cuisine, and requires careful preparation for safety due to the high-temperature oil.
            </p>

            <h3 id="make">How to make</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                        Make sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement,
                        and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire extinguisher handy,
                        just in case.
                    </li>
                            <br> 
                    <li>
                        Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the neck area and
                        make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in diameter.
                            <br>

                    <li>
                        Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on both the outside and the inside.

                    <li>
                        Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first. Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to completely cover the turkey.
                            <br>

                    <li>
                        Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.

                    <li>
                        Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; 
                        the internal temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
