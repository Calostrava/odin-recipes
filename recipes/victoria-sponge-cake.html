        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Victoria sponge cake is a classic British dessert known for its light and fluffy texture. It consists of two layers of airy sponge cake,
                traditionally made with butter, sugar, eggs, and self-rising flour. The layers are sandwiched together with sweet strawberry or raspberry
                jam and a layer of whipped cream or buttercream. Often dusted with powdered sugar on top, this simple yet elegant cake is a staple for
                afternoon tea and special occasions. Its balanced sweetness and soft texture make it a timeless favorite.

                    <li>
                        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray;
                        line bottoms with parchment paper. Lightly spray parchment paper with baking spray.

                    <li>
                        Sift flour, cornstarch, and baking powder into a medium bowl; whisk in salt and set aside.

                    <li>
                        Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. (The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color.)

                    <li>
                        Beat in eggs, one at a time, on medium speed, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next, 1 to 2 minutes total. Beat in 2 teaspoons vanilla. With mixer on medium-low speed, add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk, beating until just combined after each addition.

                        Evenly divide batter between prepared pans and spread into an even layer using a small offset spatula. Firmly tap pans on a kitchen towel-lined counter several times to help get rid of any large bubbles in the batter.

                        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 to 22 minutes. Cool cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a wire rack. Let stand, parchment side down, on wire racks until cooled completely, about 1 hour.
